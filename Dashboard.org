* Track My Courses:
    I created this to track thus encourage my progress in courses, which I undertake by myself. 
    E.g. Course be a online course such as MOOC (massively open online course) or it could be
    an offline course such as reading an book and solving its exercises.
    
    I am not paying to keep it private because even in public no one would find it of any significance
    to visit just to read my progress, apart from me :) 
    Other reason is keeping it public, anyone can see/know what kind of courses I am interested in
    and how much progress I have made. So be it open source.
    
    I will use emacs and org-mode to organise the multiple courses linking assignments, thoughts, 
    creating org files as they are formed.
